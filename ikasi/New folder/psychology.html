	What does Psychology mean? Where does it come from?
	The video gives you a 10 minute intro to one of the
	more tricky sciences and tells about some of the big
	names in the development of the field.

	The five main branches of psychology are presented: 
	neuroscience, which is a study of the mind by looking
	at the brain; developmental, which focuses on how
	people grow and learn; cognitive, which refers to 
	the computational approach to studying the mind; 
	social, which studies how people interact; and clinical, 
	which examines mental health and mental illnesses.

<p style="color: black; font-size: 23px" class="fulljustify">	This video introduces the two broad theories of how 
	the mind relates to the body. Dualism is the ubiquitous
	and intuitive feeling that our conscious mind is separate
	from our physical bodies, whereas Materialism is the
	idea that all of our mental states are caused by physical
	states of the brain. This lecture reviews arguments
	explaining why materialism has become the predominant
	theory of mind in psychology. This discussion is followed
	by a basic overview of the neurophysiology of the brain.

	This lecture introduces students to the theories of
	Sigmund Freud, including a brief biographical description
	and his contributions to the field of psychology. The 
	limitations of his theories of psychoanalysis are covered
	in detail, as well as the ways in which his conception of
	the unconscious mind still operate in mainstream 
	psychology today.

	Professor Bloom opens with a brief discussion of the 
	value and evolutionary basis of unconscious processing.
	The rest of this lecture introduces students to the
	theory of Behaviorism, particularly the work of prominent
	behaviorist, B. F. Skinner. Different types of learning
	are discussed in detail, as well as reasons why
	behaviorism has been largely displaced as an adequate
	theory of human mental life.

<p style="color: black; font-size: 23px" class="fulljustify">
	This lecture explores issues and ideas related to the
	branch of psychology known as cognitive development.
	It begins with an introduction of Piaget who, interested
	in the emergence of knowledge in general, studied 
	children and the way they learn about the world in order
	to formulate his theories of cognitive development. This
	is followed by an introduction to the modern science of 
	infant cognition. Finally, the question of the
	relationship between and the existence of different
	kinds of development is addressed.

	One of the most uniquely human abilities is the capacity
	for creating and understanding language. This lecture
	introduces students to the major topics within the study 
	of language: phonology, morphology, syntax and recursion.
	This lecture also describes theories of language
	acquisition, arguments for the specialization of language,
	and the commonalities observed in different languages
	across cultures.

<p style="color: black; font-size: 23px" class="fulljustify">
	This lecture finishes the discussion of language by
	briefly reviewing two additional topics: communication
	systems in non-human primates and other animals, and the 
	relationship between language and thought. The majority of
	this lecture is then spent on introducing students to 
	major theories and discoveries in the fields of perception
	attention and memory. Topics include why we see certain
	visual illusions, why we don't always see everything we
	think we see, and the relationship between different types
	of memory.

<p style="color: black; font-size: 23px" class="fulljustify">
	Why are people different from one another? This lecture
	addresses this question by reviewing the latest theories
	and research in psychology on two traits in particular: 
	personality and intelligence. Students will hear about
	how these traits are measured, why they may differ across
	individuals and groups, and whether they are influenced
	at all by one's genes, parents or environment.

<p style="color: black; font-size: 23px" class="fulljustify">
	The last lecture in the course wraps up the discussion
	of clinical psychology with a discussion of treatment
	efficacy. Does therapy actually work? Professor Bloom 
	summarizes the different types of influences that clinical
	interventions might have on people who receive therapy.
	Professor Bloom ends with a review of one of the most 
	interesting research topics in "positive psychology,"
	happiness. What makes us happy? How does happiness vary	
	across person and culture? What is happiness for?

	The video discusses what goes behind in the brain during
	the process of learning and also the psychology of memory.

	The video gives ideas surrounding how young people learn
	Specifically, it addresses the shift taking place in 
	learning science, to a more interdisciplinary approach
	that combines behaviorism, cognition, and constructivism.
	It highlights a new-found focus on critical thinking and
	the role played by motivation in learning. In the talk,
	the speaker utilizes some specific research on how infants
	learn the complexity of language.

<p style="color: black; font-size: 23px" class="fulljustify">	This video covers educational psychology which is the
	scientific study of human learning. The study of learning
	processes, both cognitive and affective, allows researcher
	to understand individual differences in behavior,
	personality, intellect, and self-concept. It is also
	informed by neuroscience. Educational psychology in turn
	informs a wide range of specialities within educational
	studies, including instructional design, educational
	technology, curriculum development,organizational learning
	special education and classroom management.
